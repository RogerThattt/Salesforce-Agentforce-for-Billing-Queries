# Salesforce-Agentforce-for-Billing-Queries

building an **Agent Force solution** for handling **billing queries** via **Salesforce Industries (Vlocity)** connected to **Aria Billing**. As a **Salesforce Architect**, your response must **balance user experience, platform scalability, integration complexity, and maintainability**.

Here‚Äôs a **structured solution recommendation** approach with **multiple implementation paths**, **trade-offs**, and a **final recommendation** based on Salesforce best practices.

---

## üéØ **Business Requirement**

> ‚ÄúAgents should be able to view and act on customer billing queries (e.g., invoices, payment status, disputes) inside the Salesforce Service Console. Billing data comes from Aria.‚Äù

---

## üß† **Solution Options with Trade-offs**

### **Option 1: Real-time Integration using OmniScript + Integration Procedure + Aria APIs**

**Description:**
Use an **OmniScript** to display billing information (current bill, past 5 invoices, payments, disputes) fetched in **real time** via **Integration Procedures** calling **Aria APIs**.

**Pros:**

* Real-time data accuracy (no stale data)
* Lightweight (no Salesforce data storage usage)
* Dynamic (you can cache recent invoices and reuse)
* No duplication of data (central source = Aria)

**Cons:**

* Slower performance if Aria APIs are slow
* UI-dependent (data disappears if user refreshes)
* Aria API limits and latency could affect agent experience
* Harder to implement ‚Äúreporting‚Äù or ‚Äúoffline‚Äù analytics in Salesforce

---

### **Option 2: Scheduled Data Sync to Salesforce Custom Objects (Billing Summary, Invoice, Payment)**

**Description:**
Use **MuleSoft/DataRaptor Batch** to sync Aria billing data into custom Salesforce objects every N hours.

**Pros:**

* Better agent UX: fast load, full search, list views
* Can leverage platform analytics (Reports/Dashboards, Tableau CRM)
* Easier to expose to external portals (e.g., Experience Cloud)
* Good for audit, SLAs, or historical views

**Cons:**

* Data duplication (potentially millions of records)
* Requires data archiving strategy
* More storage + governor limit usage
* Risk of data becoming stale (hourly/daily refresh)
* Complex error handling (partial syncs, failures)

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach ‚Äì Real-time on-demand fetch + local caching for trending/bulk needs**

**Description:**

* Real-time Integration Procedure fetch for most recent invoice/payment
* Daily sync for last 6 months of invoice/payment data stored in custom object
* Display both using OmniScript with DataRaptor transform logic

**Pros:**

* Fresh data where needed (current bill)
* Performance when needed (older bills preloaded)
* Supports analytics without full data sync
* Better Aria API usage control

**Cons:**

* Complex architecture and testing
* Needs careful sync rules & deduplication
* Data consistency between real-time and cached layers

---

### **Option 4: External Object (Salesforce Connect to Aria)**

**Description:**
Expose Aria‚Äôs billing tables via **Salesforce Connect** using OData or custom adapter.

**Pros:**

* No data storage in Salesforce
* Near real-time read access
* Appears like native object (read-only)

**Cons:**

* Requires Aria to support OData or implement adapter
* No offline access or analytics
* Can‚Äôt use standard reports or triggers easily
* Licenses/costs for Salesforce Connect may apply

## ‚úÖ **Final Recommended Approach (Best Practice)**

### üèÜ **Hybrid Approach: Option 3 ‚Äì Real-time + Cached Data**

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-Time Data**            | Use **Integration Procedure** with Aria API to fetch latest invoice & payment                                                          |
| **Cached Historical Data**    | Sync 6‚Äì12 months of billing history into custom objects (`Billing_Invoice__c`, `Payment__c`) daily using **MuleSoft/DataRaptor Batch** |
| **UI**                        | Design **OmniScript** (step-by-step) with conditional display: if viewing current invoice, call API; for older invoices, show cached   |
| **Error Handling**            | Implement custom logging for API failures + fallback message: ‚ÄúTry again or contact billing team‚Äù                                      |
| **Security & Access Control** | Enforce field-level security + Shield Encryption for sensitive fields (invoice amount, payment method)                                 |
| **Monitoring**                | Use **Salesforce Shield Event Monitoring** for audit + MuleSoft logs for API failures                                                  |
